**Welcome!** I am a senior at Columbia University studying Astrophysics. My primary research interests are galactic dynamics, galactic evolution, dark matter, and structure formation. During my time as an undergraduate, I have done research at the Institute for Advanced Study, Johns Hopkins University, and at my home instution, Columbia University.

Aside from research, I am  interested in conducting outreach to share the exciting world of active science and promote scientific literacy. I am also a strong believer in the benefit that creativity can bring in all aspects of life. As a result, I find myself playing, writing, and listening to music and doing photography in my free time!
