**Welcome!** I am a senior at Columbia University studying Astrophysics. My primary research interests are galactic dynamics, galactic evolution, dark matter, and structure formation. During my time as an undergraduate, I have done research at the Institute for Advanced Study, Johns Hopkins University, and at my home instution, Columbia University.

Aside from research, I am particularly interested in conducting outreach to share the exciting world of active science and promote scientific literacy. Please reach out to me with any inquires you may have!
