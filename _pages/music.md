Outside of astrophysics, music is my deepest passion. I have been playing music from as early as I can remember. My father ran a school of music when I was growing up, gaving me an opportunity to teach music from an early age. This teaching experience was how I found that I love teaching. My father, [Shawn Pfaffman](shawnpfaffman.com), is now a full-time professional jazz musician so I remain connected to the world of music. You can listen to his music on here.

I primarily play guitar and drums. I have been playing in bands starting from the age of 9 years old, primarily as a drummer.
