Outside of astrophysics, music is my deepest passion. I have been playing music from as early as I can remember. I enjoy listening to, writing, and finding new music. I mainly play guitar and drums, but I also play bass, piano, and I sing. I am currently writing and recording an album that I plan on releasing on all platforms soon. I like to play indie rock, funk, blues, experimental music, and a fusion of all of these genres. Besides writing and playing music, I also collect vinyl records, which is a great way to find new music.

My father ran a school of music when I was growing up, gaving me an opportunity to teach music from an early age. This teaching experience was how I found that I love teaching. My father, [Shawn Pfaffman](https://shawnpfaffman.com), is now a full-time professional jazz musician so I remain connected to the world of music. You can listen to his music on here.

I primarily play guitar and drums. I have been playing in bands starting from the age of 9 years old, primarily as a drummer.

My first band, Tone Revival, won the 2015 Jacksonville Teen Battle of the Bands, played on the [news](https://youtu.be/A941TcUCSWQ?si=otIGGy5a6UySgver), and released an [album](https://open.spotify.com/album/5KwnRafScb74pkudTzh5mO?si=kBpOI_GxRIqRq7ZlRB7-sw) on spotify when I was in middle school.

I also played drums for a blues band, Allie and the Kats, from 2015 to 2017. We won the 2016 Jacksonville Teen Battle of the Bands and were selected to represent Jacksonville in the youth showcase of the International Blues Challenge two years in a row (2016, 2017). I also played in a few jazz and funk groups during high school as well.

In my senior year of high school, I started a surf rock band called [seagate](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1CG2dngFczwDOZ9mks5SE8?si=UjwUi1BcQOyv42cDvgO16g). Before leaving the band to go to college, we recorded and released Flower Dress, which as over 40,000 streams on spotify.
