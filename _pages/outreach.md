Along with my passion for outer space, I possessed an interest in outreach and humanitarian activism from a young age. Eight years ago I created [Space First](https://www.spacefirst.org), born at the nexus of these interests. Originally a platform to share active developments in astronomy and space travel, the focus of Space First shifted to outreach and science communication as time went on. 

In 2018 and 2019, I started and ran the [Future Voyager Fund](https://www.spacefirst.org/future-voyager-scholarship.html) through Space First to provide an underpriveledged middle schooler with science resources, such as a 3D printer and a Raspberry Pi, to grow their interest in STEM. Unfortunately, I halted the fundraiser in 2020 due to the pandemic, concerned with the ethics of fundraising at the time. I plan to bring the Future Voyager Fund back with reimagined fundraising and recipient selection criteria. 

I actively post on the Space First [blog](https://www.spacefirst.org/blog) about various topics, ranging from hot topics in astrophysics, space travel updates, and a glipse into the life of someone stuying astrophysics.

I recently started sharing animations and short talks on [youtube](https://youtube.com/@sgpspace). Some of the animations are intended to be teaching tools, such as this visualization of a radius versus time plot of a star's orbit.
<div class="row justify-content-center">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0 text-center">
        {% include video.html path="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RsmxoaW-1ug?si=RR35v0HT8RK_bCdP" title="Video 1" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" controls=true autoplay=true width="560" height="315"%}
    </div>
</div>
This animation is meant to build intuition for this animation of phase mixing in shell formation for individuals unfamiliar with this kind of plot.
<div class="row justify-content-center">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0 text-center">
        {% include video.html path="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O4corKdCKxI?si=5AuTZt9771SQ1PZ8" title="Video 2" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" controls=true autoplay=true width="560" height="315"%}
    </div>
</div> 
In other cases, my animations are meant to efficiently communicate the methods and results of research in an academic setting. I am often thinking about how I can use animations to explain my work in a more efficient, intuitive, and accessible way.

I am also a math tutor for the [Reading Team Math](https://www.communityservice.columbia.edu/content/reading-team) team, where we offer weekly tutoring to elementary school students in Harlem.
