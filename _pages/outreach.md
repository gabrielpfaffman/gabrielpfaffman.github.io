My passion for outreach began around 8 years ago when I created [Space First](spacefirst.org). Originally a platform to share active developments in astronomy and space travel, the focus of Space First shifted to outreach and science communication as time went on. 

In 2018 and 2019, I started and ran the [Future Voyager Fund](https://www.spacefirst.org/future-voyager-scholarship.html) through Space First to provide an underpriveledged middle schooler with science resources, such as a 3D printer and a Raspberry Pi, to grow their interest in STEM. Unfortunately, I halted the fundraiser in 2020 due to the pandemic, concerned with the ethics of fundraising at the time. I plan to bring the Future Voyager Fund back with reimagined fundraising and receipient selection criteria. 

I actively post on the Space First [blog](https://www.spacefirst.org/blog) about various topics, ranging from hot topics in astrophysics, space travel updates, and a glipse into the life of someone stuying astrophysics.

I am also a math tutor for the [Reading Team Math](https://www.communityservice.columbia.edu/content/reading-team) team, where we offer weekly tutoring to elementary school students in Harlem.
