## **Detailed Overview**

With Dr. Tomer Yavetz at the Institute for Advanced Study, I investigate the influence of an oscillating central potential in the host galaxy on the formation of stellar shells. This statement might not mean a lot to you right now, but I hope that after reading this page it will make more sense. I motivate each component of the project and detail the setup we chose in the following sections.

### Oscillating Central Potentials
The conventional practice in galaxy research (disregarding unique cases such as spiral arms, bars, and subhalos) is to treat the potential of the galaxy as static. However, many theories predict that the central region of many galaxies have temporal density oscillations at small radii. Notably, this behavior is demonstrated in simulations of Fuzzy Dark Matter halos. 

Agreeing with intuition, the dynamical effect of this oscillating central potential on some structure in this galaxy is maximized when you are closer to the region of oscillation. Conveniently, very unique structure forms in the static case when you merge a small galaxy with a larger galaxy on a trajectory that comes close to the center: stellar shells.

## **Brief Overview**
### Introduction
Stellar shells are concentric layers of stars encircling some galaxies. These shells are formed when a smaller progenitor galaxy merges with a larger host galaxy, a scenario most frequently observed in nature when the progenitor follows a highly eccentric orbit around the host galaxy [1].

With Dr. Tomer Yavetz at the Institute for Advanced Study, I investigate the influence of an oscillating central potential in the host galaxy on the formation of stellar shells. The physical motivation for this investigation lies in the predicted behavior of galaxies with Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM) halos. 

FDM is a proposed form of dark matter that is composed of ultralight scalar axions, with a de Broglie wavelength on the scale of approximately a kpc. Central oscillations in the seen in FDM simulations due to wave-like interference patterns [2].

### Methods
The host galaxy's potential was generated by creating a spherically symmetric density profile with a sinusoidally oscillating core and an NFW envelope [3] and solving the Poisson Equation, simplified for spherical symmetry.

We conducted a test particle simulation using leapfrog integration, interpolating acceleration from the above table. The progenitor, with a mass $m_{prog} = 1.1 \times 10^4 M_{\odot}$, was populated with test particles normally distributed around its center. The host galaxy has a mass of $m_{host} = 1.1 \times 10^8 M_{\odot}$ [4].

    **Figure 3.** The top and bottom figures depict the 2D spatial distribution of test particle shells with differing central potential oscillation periods at ùë° = 15.24 ùëá!"#$%. Oscillation periods and the simulation time are represented in terms of the radial period of the progenitor base orbit, ùëá!"#$% = 2.5 ùê∫ùë¶ùëü. The periods vary from significantly shorter periods than the time required to traverse the central region to substantially longer periods.

* As expected, the effect of the central potential oscillation is negligible in cases where the oscillation period is much greater or much less than the time for the progenitor to cross the central region (top left and bottom right cells of Figure 3). The shells formed in this regime are nearly identical to the typical shells formed in a static potential.

* Amplitude convergence tests show that the shells in the oscillating potential expand and contract around the static case (QR Code 2).
* Figure 3 shows that the oscillating central potential translates to varying the energy in the system, impacting the typical shell structure. In certain cases, this process leads to the formation of additional structure (new over densities, such as in the $T / T_{orbit}$ = 0.04 case) or a total destruction of structure (such as in the $T / T_{orbit}$ = 0.28 case).

### Conclusions
* One likely explanation for the changes to the typical shell structure is a resonance between the potential oscillation periods and the time to traverse the central region.
* An immediate next step is to use a realistic FDM potential produced from a full scale FDM simulation to see if the disruption is replicated.
* Stellar shell formation in an oscillating potential may also have implications outside of FDM, such as with other physical situations like a rotating bar.
* One future avenue is to identify observable signatures of an oscillating central region.
* An observable signature of this phenomenon could provide compelling evidence for FDM as a primary DM candidate.
* The next generation of telescopes, such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory/LSST [5] and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope [6], may allow us to probe shells around not only large galaxies, but also dwarf galaxies.
