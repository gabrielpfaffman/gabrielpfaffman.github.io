That’s a lot of jargon, so I will break down each part in the following sections. <br> <br></p> <h3 id="oscillating-central-potentials">Oscillating Central Potentials</h3> <p>Let’s start with a the following simplified model of a galaxy. <br></p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/galgraphic1-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/galgraphic1-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/galgraphic1-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/galgraphic1.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="Figure 2" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>The circle in the middle with the squiggly line represents the visible matter of the galaxy. This is what you think of when you think of galaxies: spiral arms, a bar, stars, gas, etc. The dotted line surrounding the visible matter represents the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter_halo" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">dark matter halo</a>. Dark matter halos are known to exist from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_rotation_curve" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">rotation curve</a> data. This diagram is not to scale, as in reality the dark matter halo is significantly larger than the visible part of the galaxy.</p> <p>The conventional practice in galaxy research (disregarding unique cases such as spiral arms, bars, and subhalos) treats the potential and density of galaxies as static in time. In other words, the density of the galaxy only depends on <em>where</em> you are in the galaxy, not <em>when</em> you observe it.</p> <p>However, many theories predict that the central region of many galaxies have temporal density oscillations at small radii. For example, this effect is predicted for a dark matter halo of Fuzzy Dark Matter, an theorized ultralight form of dark matter that abides by quantum mechanics at galactic scales. We may see similar behavior with a rotating bar as well.Let’s update our model, adding a red circle for the region with oscillating density. For our purposes, we are only concerned with the dark matter halo, so I have removed the visible matter from the diagram.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/galgraphic2-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/galgraphic2-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/galgraphic2-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/galgraphic2.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="Figure 2" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navarro%E2%80%93Frenk%E2%80%93White_profile" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) density profile</a> is used for the outer region, since this density profile converges with Cold Dark Matter (the more conventionally used dark matter model) and observations at large radii.

Conveniently, very unique structure forms (in a static potential) when you merge a small galaxy with a larger galaxy on a trajectory that comes close to the center: stellar shells. <br> <br></p> <h3 id="stellar-shells">Stellar Shells</h3> <p>Before moving forward, let’s get some intuition for stellar shell formation and morphology in a conventional, static potential. Consider the following setup: a dwarf galaxy (blue) merging with the dark matter halo of an elliptical galaxy on a radial trajectory (dashed blue).</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/galgraphic3-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/galgraphic3-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/galgraphic3-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/galgraphic3.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="Figure 2" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>We refer to the smaller galaxy in this situation as the <strong><em>progenitor</em></strong> and the larger galaxy as the <strong><em>host</em></strong>. The progenitor contains stars with different energies and angular momenta, both quantities that do not change through time with a static potential. First, the energy governs what the furthest point of the orbit is (apocenter) and how long it takes a star to go from one apocenter to another, \(T_{orbit}\).</p> <p>Having a distribution of energy means that stars in the progenitor are progressing through there orbits at different speeds and they have different peak radii. As a result, the the progenitor will begin to spread along the radial direction. This is called <em>radial phase mixing</em>. Once the mixing has gone on for long enough, some stars may even begin to lap other stars.</p> <p>To understand this process a bit more, let’s look at a graph of radius versus time for all of the stars in a progenitor galaxy. This following animation gives intuition for how a radius versus time plot relates to an orbit in cartesian space.</p> <div class="row justify-content-center"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0 text-center"> <figure> <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RsmxoaW-1ug?si=yqfCFzDFhcKl6PcU" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" width="560" height="315" title="Video 1"></iframe> </figure> </div> </div> <p>Now, let’s give this star some friends and remake the same animation.</p> <div class="row justify-content-center"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0 text-center"> <figure> <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O4corKdCKxI" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" width="560" height="315" title="Video 1"></iframe> </figure> </div> </div> <p>By looking at the density of particles on any verticle strip, you can understand how the stars are distributed by radius. Looking at the vertical strip on the far right cooresponds to the radius of all particles at the current moment. Looking at the vertical strip on the far right of the following snapshot, notice that there are two overdensities, labeled <strong>1</strong> and <strong>2</strong>.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/phasemixing-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/phasemixing-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/phasemixing-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/phasemixing.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1 zoomable=true" width="auto" height="auto" title="Figure 2" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>These two overdensities correspond to the two <strong><em>shells</em></strong> that exist at this time. Now trace the overdensities backwards in time. As you can see, they form at a lower radius and move outwards. However, the moving shells, which are boxed in red, aren’t formed of a single group of stars slowly moving outward, rather it is new stars progressively reaching apocenter. As a result, we see each shell fade in and fade out as all of the stars eventually pass through. We can also see the shells overlapping, which is what I referred to as the stars “lapping” each other earlier.</p> <p>The stars bunch up at apocenter because this is the point where they are moving slowest, meaning that they are more likely to be there since this is a highly elliptical orbit. This is analogous to how a block oscillating on a spring moves slowest when it is at its maximum displacement. Considering the stars move slowest at apocenter in this situation, you have a better chance of finding stars at apocenter, which is why we see the bunches of stars at apocenter.</p> <p>Now that we have looked into what the effect of a spread of energy is, let’s consider angular momentum. The angular momentum of a star essentially expresses how much tangential velocity (scaled by its radius) a star has. Since there is a small spread of initial radii in the progenitor, the spread of angular momentum basically informs us how much the stars will spread in the azimuthal direction. This is called <em>azimuthal phase mixing</em>.</p> <p>Another way to visualize the distribution of energy and angular momentum by coloring each star based on its energy and angular momentum.</p> <div class="row justify-content-center"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0 text-center"> <figure> <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c2iGJToknXs?si=zZaGcYTjjmNU6Nuo" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" width="560" height="315" title="Video 1"></iframe> </figure> </div> </div> <p>As you can see in the animation, energy varies in the radial direction and the angular momentum varies along the azimuthal direction.</p> <p>Combining these these two forms of mixing produces a <em>shell</em> structure.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0 text-center"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/shell_irl-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/shell_irl-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/shell_irl-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/shell_irl.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="Figure 2" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>Stellar shells are relatively common, present in about 20% of elliptical and lenticular galaxies.

When \(T_{core} ~ T_{orbit}\), structure is either entirely destroyed or new structure may be created. These results are shown in the following video, where the top left and the bottom right cells are the cases where \(T_{core} &lt;&lt; T_{orbit}\) and \(T_{core} &gt;&gt; T_{orbit}\) respectively.</p> <div class="row justify-content-center"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0 text-center"> <figure> <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KV_E998ff2k?si=3jyiSDs50IYMDNHY" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" width="560" height="315" title="Video 1"></iframe> </figure> </div> </div> <p>The resulting effect when \(T_{core} ~ T_{orbit}\) is dependent on the resonance between the two oscillations.
