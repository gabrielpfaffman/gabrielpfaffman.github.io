These shells are formed when a smaller progenitor galaxy merges with a larger host galaxy, a scenario most frequently observed in nature when the progenitor follows a highly eccentric orbit around the host galaxy [1].</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/shell_irl-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/shell_irl-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/shell_irl-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/shell_irl.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="Figure 1" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> **Figure 1.** Hubble image of the galaxy ESO 381-12, containing several stellar shells.

The physical motivation for this investigation lies in the predicted behavior of galaxies with Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM) halos.</p> <p>FDM is a proposed form of dark matter that is composed of ultralight scalar axions, with a de Broglie wavelength on the scale of approximately a kpc.
